# Getting Started with Netlify

Create your own 3D world by building off of this multiplayer voxel editor. This editor is powered by the realtime multiplayer library, [y-sweet](https://github.com/jamsocket/y-sweet).

Host your y-sweet project using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and the [Jamsocket Extension](https://netlify.com/integrations/jamsocket) on Netlify.

To run this app yourself,

1. Clone this repo and deploy it on Netlify as a site
2. Install the [Jamsocket Netlify Extension](https://netlify.com/integrations/jamsocket)
3. Create a y-sweet project through the Jamsocket Extension, which will set the necessary environment variables to run your app.
4. See your app live!

In local development, simply run `npm run dev`.
